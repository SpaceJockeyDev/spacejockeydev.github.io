        "description": "Enemy You first debuted on the four-way split dubbed \"Four On The Floor\" alongside bands Screeching Weasel, Teen Idols, and Moral Crux.  A fine start among fine company that set the stage for their full length on Lookout! Records: \"Where No One Knows My Name\".  Then came shows, tours, and even a track on the illustrious \"Short Music For Short People\" compilation.  The band spent a good long time working on their next proper full length, \"Stories Never Told\", and that’s what we have here.  After hearing bits of the unfinished record we at Red Scare were anxious to work with the band, and tada, here we are!  You’d be surprised as to what you can accomplish with a little sweet talk and a lot of Wild Turkey. Enemy You has toured the West Coast multiple times and played shows with all the punk rock heavies: NOFX, Bad Religion, Bouncing Souls, Lagwagon, etc.  And in support of Stories they will continue to play frequently on the Left Coast as well as embark on their first big national tour of the States.  With a new record to tout and a slew of shows to play, nothing can hold back these Bay Area dynamos!  Except perhaps some more Wild Turkey…",

        "description": "The first proper full-length album from Wyoming’s favorite sons!  In light of the dismal musical climate (shaggy haircuts, make-up, trite screamo vocals, etc), it would seem that isolation has only strengthened this band’s songwriting.  Rather than waste their time with low-cut jeans, these young upstarts spend their efforts writing infectious punk songs, and they delivered the best Ramones-core record of the new millennium.  I’m not exaggerating, folks.  Read on!  Shortly after Teenage Bottlerocket agreed to work with Red Scare, they added a second guitarist.  Oh, not just ANY guitarist, it was Kody from Lookout’s legendary pop punk trio the Lillingtons.  I feel like the luckiest guy this side of the Cowboy State!  Better yet, Kody went on to write and sing half the songs on \"Total\", making this  debut bound for success.  The only possible way we could improve on this wondrous kismet is if Joey and Dee Dee rose from the grave to make guest appearances.  But we figured that we should leave SOMETHING for the next record…",

It was their breakthrough, and anyone who overlooked that LP missed out on the BEST pop punk record of 2004.  We then hooked up to release a hilarious party album \"21st Century Power Pop Riot\" that featured The Methadones with a number of guest vocalists covering Cheap Trick, Costello, and more.  Now it’s back to business, and the ‘Dones have a new batch of originals that pick up where they left off with the great \"Not Economically Viable\".  It’s called \"This Won’t Hurt...\" and they recorded it at the famed Atlas Studios in Chi-Town.  The same guys that brought you stuff from The Lawrence Arms and Alkaline Trio have captured The Methadones in all their glory and have them sounding better than ever.  Fronted by the venerable Dan Vapid, they have yet another album full of undeniable hits and on top of all this, they have two tours booked in the near future…hide your beer and chicken wings!",

After garnering quite a buzz in neighboring towns, we at Red Scare saw their live show and were immediately sold on ‘em.  Because of their varied influences, Cobra Skulls deliver a record so dynamic that everyone’s ears will perk up.  And just when you think they’ve ran outta tricks, they bust out with songs in Spanish…aye carumba!  Their parents are gonna be especially proud because these guys are quitting their jobs and planning on touring for the rest of 2007.

Aside from playing countless packed shows, they are responsible for founding an especially promising Latino punk rock scene that has recently arisen from SF’s Mission District.  But La Plebe make it a point not to be pigeonholed as they want to be known primarily for their rambunctious songs.  And these guys are popular for a reason: they play the hits, Señor!  So after a local label released 3 EPs, we brought them aboard in an effort to share this brilliant bilingual punk band with the rest of the punk/ska world.  They then went into Motor Studios and cranked out a record under the direction of producer Bill Gould (founding member of Faith No More, Brujeria), and the result is their breakthrough LP, \"¡Hasta La Muerte!\".  They tell me that means “’Til Death!”, but it could mean “Our Label Sucks!” for all I know…These guys have an undeniable live show, so look for them in your town as they tour the world!",

It all started here, and this short but powerful burst is an essential Cobra Skulls release of poignant punk rock that takes aim at a reckless government in a world gone mad.",

Cobra Skulls have sharpened their fangs by playing hundreds of shows all over the globe and their 2nd full length, \"American Rubicon\", is the follow-up that the underground has been waiting for.  17 venomous tracks recorded in snowy Chicago during the winter of '09 by Matt Allison at Atlas Studios (Alkaline Trio, Less Than Jake, etc).  This new record is more dynamic than anything you've heard from Cobra Skulls and these bilingual punks offer up songs about the apocalypse, young love, punk scene politics, perpetual war, and even their own sordid upbringing.  This is the kind of music that god-hating South American revolutionaries tune up their hot rods and comb their hair to.  How do we know?  Because they're in the band!",

        "description": "This latest effort from The Sidekicks is a real product of their environment and the vibrant underground music scene around them in Northern Ohio.  Less raw and punky, \"Weight Of Air\" is a surprisingly sophisticated release from the young quartet, and this time they draw more from Midwestern indie-punk influences like the Replacements, the Weakerthans, and Promise Ring.  Lots of instrumentation, mature songwriting, youthful energy, and some of the catchiest hooks we've heard from any Red Scare band add up to an impressive follow-up.  They may not be old enough to gamble and drink yet, but you can expect a lot more great music and great shows from these fresh-faced Clevelanders.",

Bands of all stripes from different sub-scenes and from far-off places like Israel and Sweden.  The Utters may have started out as an earnest, working-class punk band from San Francisco, but their music has reached audiences far and wide.  This collection is a testament to just how relevant and influential Swingin' Utters are to all of us, and most importantly, this is the punk scene's way of saying thanks.",

One listen to their Red Scare debut, \"Savages\", will reveal to the world that Vultures United and their brand of dark, deviant hardcore cannot be categorized.  It will, however, give you nightmares.  Enjoy.",

Their new 13-song full length, <I>Species Bender</I>, is proof of all the great progress they’ve made as a band and will firmly plant ‘em alongside the genre’s best. We’re talking about a truly rockin’ record, and The Brokedowns are one of the few bands still playing traditional punk rock and playing it well. On top of all that, they package it with hilarious, biting lyrics: songs that reference the Octo-Mom, wizards, Jersey Shore, Kid Rock, etc. That’s what I call a good fuckin’ time.",

You heard right: this group was formed in a trailer park in Southern Illinois (not far from where they host the annual Gathering of the Jugggalos) and the band is made up entirely of trailer park denizens.  Sadly, The Heat Tape are NOT a buncha hilljacks making music inspired by zoophilia and Funyuns.  It's actually long-time Red Scare comrade Brett Hunter (The Copyrights, Dear Landlord) making feverishly infectious lo-fi ditties with his friends in his mobile home.  It reminds us of The Thermals, Jay Reatard, The Marked Men...if that helps.  We fell in love on the first listen and now we're bringing you some insights from the backcountry; so mix up that Mountain Dew with some vodka (they call that a Voo Dew in Makanda) and give this shit a spin.",

        "description": "This young four-piece from Colorado roamed the basements and punk houses of America for a couple years as the band 10-4 Eleanor, and after building quite a following among the sweaty/bearded segment of the underground, they opted for a new band name and a fresh start in 2011.  Thus ushered in the era of Elway, and along with it comes their Red Scare debut, \"Delusions\".  It marks an ambitious step up for the band as they ditched their home recordings and enlisted audio guru Matt Allison at Atlas Studios (Alkaline Trio, Lawrence Arms, LTJ, Smoke or Fire, etc).  Rest assured, this new one retains all the guts and grime that these guys are known for, but with more intricacy and nuance than you'd expect from your average \"beardo\" punk band.  \"Delusions\" is thematically inspired by two things: our society's regard for God and having to deal with maniacal loved ones; and these brainy rockers from the Rocky Mountains are sure to capture plenty of attention with this impressive beginning.",

This is gritty, anthemy, thrashy, and melodic punk rock.  The 11 songs on this self-titled debut are just the first course in the delicious feast we expect from these Philadelphia wonderboys.

        "description": "Brendan Kelly is a blogger, father, TV host, and frontman of The Lawrence Arms; and this newest rock band was formed in the spirit of other artist collectives like Wu-Tang Clan and Crass. The ambitious 12-song debut is a brave collaboration of friends (musicians, graphic artists, studio nerds, and even a college film professor) and it offers diverse songs and ample instrumentation to set this album apart from the typical punker-goes-acoustic project. The Wandering Birds employ distorted guitars, vibraphone, lap steel, drum loops, piano, and more to deliver a true departure—both musically and thematically—on this dynamic record.",

Armed with that breakout album, they toured their asses off, made lotsa friends, and won over loads of new fans.  Something else must've happened in that time, because Elway's songwriting has further improved, and that's clearly evident on these four new tunes that make up \"Hence My Optimism\".  These are gutsy and efficient punk songs, sure to please the Elway faithful, but even more certain to garner them more new fans.  Think The Lawrence Arms meets Propagandhi; it really is a promising step up for the band and a big favorite here at the Red Scare HQ.",

In the early days, their kooky-looking frontman Stevo would get so trashed that he would berate the crowd with his goofy tales and end up in the fetal position on stage.  Good times, no doubt.  The band kept moving forward and their reputation for wild shows only grew; and being known around the punk scene for being a kickass band and all-around good dudes, they got tour offers from bands like Off With Their Heads, The Lawrence Arms, The Flatliners, Dead To Me, and A Wilhelm Scream.  At some point they actually got their shit together to hone their live show, perfect their songwriting, and then headed into Atlas Studios to record their debut album with Matt Allison (Alkaline Trio, Less Than Jake, Smoking Popes, etc).  And here we have it: Farty Degas (or whatever that dumb album title is); the latest offering from the most depraved batch of assholes to come swinging out of the super exciting Philly punk underground.  Ten tracks so hot that they'll blister your dick up to the point where you'll look like the guys in The Holy Mess.",

Then we enlisted All-American Rejects guitarist and audio maven Mike Kennerty to ensure these 12 apocalyptic episodes were captured properly on tape.

Nothington's dueling vocals and gritty singalong melodies have taken these boys all over the world, and this release is essential for devoted fans of the band, but also makes an excellent gateway for the uninitiated.",

In contrast to Sam's full-band approach, Brendan's two songs are sparsely tracked in the backroom of a bar, but bear his trademark wit and melodic rasp that have made him an alt-punk hero.

Well, this is way better than Everclear. \"Breakdown\" is like dark, new wave Americana.  Imagine if Prince and Ryan Adams went on a road trip and confessed all their wrongdoing.  It'd be cathartic and grim, but it'd also be awesome and weird.  Most people know Derek Grant as the ripping drummer in Alkaline Trio, but he's been making music for years and can sing and play any instrument like a virtuoso.  It's actually really unfair and annoying how good he is at making music.  The release of this batch of songs is the final bit of closure on a rough, turbulent part of Derek's life, and thankfully for us, the final product is much more upbeat and likable than the trials that inspired \"Breakdown\".",

This year is already looking good for Success: they're booked at some big festivals and playing shows with Masked Intruder, they've been included on S1D's Warped Tour comp, and were among the \"Bands You Need To Know in 2015\" as picked by Alternative Press.

Gone are the \"party punk\" tunes, and instead there's more riffy, 90's alt-rock like Sunny Day Real Estate or Seaweed.

        "description": "To better understand Arms Aloft you need to get to know their homeland, The Great Lakes.  No no, not Chicago or Cleveland or Detroit, these punk weirdos are from THE NORTH.  Half the band hails from Minneapolis and the other two lumberjacks are from Eau Claire, WI.  Up in that neck of the woods the people wear large bricks of cheese upon their heads in a display of provincial unity.  Ya sure, ya betcha.  Well, these kids were destined for more than a life of ice-fishing and drinking Rhinelanders at the sawmill, so they started a band and caught people's attention with their leftist message and raspy melodies.  And on \"What A Time To Be Barely Alive\" they have 12 songs that take rootsy punk (like Billy Bragg and early Gaslight Anthem) and blend it with the personal politics of bands like The Clash and Dillinger Four.  Plus, the cover art has a herd of swine busting out of a pigpen.  Ain't that some shit?",

        "description": "These three Irish lads originally come from around Belfast/Northern Ireland but they moved to Newcastle, England to get shitty jobs and form a band.  The jobs did indeed turn out to be shitty, but the band turned out great!  The youngsters hammered away at the songs and their rowdy music quickly drew friends and fans to the party.  They sold out their first hometown show and figured it was time for their first proper release, and that's when we got involved.  Singer Adam has been a Red Scare comrade since he was a wee sprog (that's Irish for young kid) and the first listen had us sold on the songs. \"Ride The Storm\" is 10 tracks of rock-influenced punk that remind us of bands like Alkaline Trio, The Flatliners, and Millencolin.  There's Gaelic folklore, drinking songs, and nautical themes throughout this debut album.  We at Red Scare love discovering promising young bands from weird places and bringing them to the rest of the world, and we have another winner with Good Friend!",

Over the last couple years we've encouraged her to keep writing songs and she surprised us all by assembling a great band and recording an impressive album. Her debut, \"Rhombithian\", was Produced by Matt Jordan (You Blew It!, Dowsing, etc.) and pairs the sounds of Chicago punk and the youthful Midwest \"emo revival\" movement.

If there was any justice, Sicko woulda been just as popular as all those huge punk bands that emerged in the 1990's.  While much of the West Coast stuff that dominated the scene was macho and bedecked with wallet chains, Sicko was contemporaries with classy bands like MTX, Jawbreaker, and J-Church.  They were nerds, and they were OUR nerds.  Our champions.  After four LPs, the band dissolved in 1998 and, true to form, the members went on to pursue tech careers and attend Oxford.  But now we've put together a collection/anthology to remind young pop-punks how it's done.  19 remastered songs, hand-picked by the band, and accompanied by some cool art and fun liner notes.  A great collection of hits for the old fans -OR- the perfect introduction for new listeners!",

Strangely, in spite of a lack of recognition from the important internet tastemakers, it went on to be their best-received effort to date.  The band did LESS stuff... and got more popular?  Yes, it even confused us omniscient music geniuses at Red Scare Industries.  So now the Colorado quartet is back with another self-produced album and this time it takes aim at the critics, naysayers, and scenester shit-talkers.  They're calling the record \"For The Sake Of The Bit\".  Hmmm.  It's raw-sounding, defiant, a bit snarky, and the band is actually gonna get off their ass this time for some festivals and a tour with Dead To Me.  With some new tunes and a little elbow grease, Elway might finally get acknowledged by the greats at Pitchfork and NPR.  Haha, JK, those guys can still suck it.",

        "description": "\"SkyTigers\" is five new hits and 21 minutes of Heartland punk from Red City Radio with some balls-trippin' art to boot, baby!  Red Scare has a peculiar knack for plucking bands out of unlikely locations.  We've developed acts from towns like Laramie, Enumclaw, Scranton, Carbondale, Haverhill, Reno, Eau Claire... the boonies!  We may know squat about the music biz, but sure as shit can spot talent in a dive bar.  Now we have yet another group of overachieving underdogs: straight outta Oklahoma, it's Red City Radio.  Their last full length was probably our favorite album of 2015, but when their major label subsidiary went outta business (high five!) after only a couple months, we reached out as fans to lend a hand to this great punk quartet.  Their crowds have doubled in size since that last release, so we expect big things from these Okies with \"SkyTigers\".  To make damn sure, we enlisted producer by Mike Kennerty and mixer by Matt Allison, so you know this EP is destined to end up in the cosmos­—which is probably where they found that two-headed beastie on the cover.  Far fucking OUT, man!",

We reached out right away and basically demanded that they join us at Red Scare.  They’re called Tightwire, and they’re giving you 13 self-recorded blasts on this debut album entitled, \"Six Feet Deep\", mixed by Matt Allison (Alkaline Trio, Dead To Me, The Menzingers).  The two singers, Paul and Tane, offer the kinda dark/poppy jams you would expect from salty MPLS punks: love songs, drinking songs, angry songs, drinking songs, funny songs, drinking songs, etc.   This should go down as one of the best pop-punk albums of the year, and you can expect lotsa tours from this Midwest trio as they already have shows booked with Dillinger Four and Off With Their Heads.",

Many people tell us that 2012’s \"I’d Rather Die Than Live Forever\" is the best release on Red Scare, but those people are idiots.  (I mean, it’s good but COME ON.)  After a lot of sold out shows and apparently a lot of time spent in dive bars and seedy hotels, Brendan has returned with a new batch of illicit goods. Back with the Birds is Bren’s BFF and co-conspirator, filmmaker Nick Martin.  They’ve also added two new partners in crime on these 10 godless hymns: Derek Grant of Alkaline Trio and Dan Tinkler from Atlas Studios.  This latest LP is called \"Keep Walkin’ Pal\", and we’re not sure if it’s Space Rock or Chiptune or what, but we know that it’s reliably dirty and real likeable.  This is not some emo boy with a guitar or another “punk goes acoustic” outing, this is fresh American rock ‘n’ roll that will appeal to punks, drunks, and weirdos.",

The wee lad is known as a punk troubadour who has covered a LOT of ground in Europe and America with his acoustic guitar, but on Billy's debut album, \"Some Legacy\", our hero is backed by a loud rock band.  Imagine a horde of rowdy punks led by a very, very small version of William Wallace with big songs about friendship, despair, tolerance, love, anxiety, and life in Edinburgh.  It's an 11-song uplifting battle cry that will rally all the clans!",

FOUR BUCKS.  So then they get asked to play shows with bands like The Lawrence Arms, The Menzingers, etc. and people are really responding to their songs and their fun shows.  Next we shipped 'em up to Boston to record with Jay Maas (State Champs, Seaway, Title Fight) and they crank out the coolest record of 2019: \"Deals, Deals, Deals!\".  See, it even sounds like a fun time.  The band has a tour lined up with Teenage Bottlerocket and who knows what's next... probably something with Chainsmokers, those guys are equally hot right now.",

The keen observer will recognize some Red Scare covers in the mix.  That, along with some cool artwork/liner notes and a bonus poster with the vinyl make this a pretty sweet package.  Needless to say, it requires a lot of support from listeners and the underground music community to last this long, and these fifteen hits are the best way we can repay y’all.

We’re off to a good start.  What you need to know is that “L’ennui” is not only a strong outing for the Frenchman, this new one has all their talents on display.  There’s catchy pop-punk, hardcore songs, and the rowdy anthems we’ve come to expect from Guerilla Poubelle.  Plus the lyrical content on here is extra fiery.  À La Flambé, if you will.  Apparently the French have been real pissed lately?  So if you wanna brush up on your Français and you’re into bands like Arms Aloft, RVIVR, Against Me!, and Strike Anywhere... this is the album for you.",

And “Back To The Party” is a special one.  This is a diverse-sounding record with a broad spectrum of emotions on display.  You can hear the loyalty and the love, the fear and the hope, the desperation and the triumph.  You can also hear Sam trying new things as he crafts 33 minutes of his best stuff yet.  It’s a bold mix of styles that we haven’t yet heard from the British balladeer, and we know Sam’s devoted following are hungry for his first new LP in five years.  When he’s not toiling away out in the farmland of East Anglia, he’ll be playing shows and festivals in Europe and America, so get ready for Sam’s party in 2020 and beyond…",

All their songs are about battle and they wear Medieval helms when they play. At first we laughed nervously and thought it was all a gag, but this music is hardcore Oi! that’ll give you nightmares. Think of bands like The Templars, Rixe, Blitz, Noi!se, Lion’s Law, etc. This debut 4-song EP will definitely turn some heads in the Streetpunk world, so get on their good side before they invade the scene.",

You won’t find that in today’s punk scene where there’s so much competition and grubbing for clout on social media, but these bands are binary stars from a bygone era.  The two respective singers started out as pen pals (yes, using actual letters and stamps!) and went on to be songwriting contemporaries and labelmates on Lookout and Red Scare.  In the world of melodic punk, The Lillingtons and Enemy You are the gold standard.  Then  David Jones (singer of Enemy You) suddenly passed away in 2015 and bands have been paying him tribute ever since.  On “Can Anybody Hear Me” we have The Lillingtons offering up a few EY cover songs and it feels like a family reunion.  The first pressing of the vinyl will come on “Jones Hoodie Red” and a portion of proceeds will be donated towards to National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.",

Imagine the smooth melodies of the Smoking Popes blended with rowdy Midwest punk like Dillinger Four.  Look, they have three singers, so they can kinda do what they want, ya know?  And with LeBron outta the way, Cleveland is long overdue for a punk champion!  “Twistin’ The Knife Away” may be their Red Scare debut, but this band is no stranger to live shows.  They’ll be hitting the road and reppin’ the North Coast all over the globe in support of this fantastic LP.  And have we mentioned they got three singers?!?",

These guys have played all over the world (Europe, Japan, South America, Australia, etc.) and made their name perfecting melodic hardcore, but this new 13-song record has something for everyone.  Dynamic indie-punk of all stripes can be heard on \"Dr. Album\", and this doctor has an IV bag of hooks, choruses, melodies, and ferocious lyrics that you’ll wanna inject straight into your veins.  Side note: Did you know that Emma Goldman opened an ice cream shop in Worcester (AKA Wormtown) back in the 1800’s?  It’s true, and Saint Emma would be proud of these scrappy punks and this Left-Wing masterpiece.  It may have taken a decade, but No Trigger is relentless, and the band is playing Riot Fest, Punk In Drublic Festival, and shows with The Lawrence Arms in support of these new songs.

        "description": "This 14-song full length was originally released by Bloodshot Records in 2018, but because it contains the potent “I Hate Chicago” diss track, it’s sacred writ that the album needs to be on a Windy City record label.  So basically, we drew the short straw and now it’s our cross to bear.  Laura Jane Grace is best known for fronting indie-punk titans, Against Me!, but on “Bought To Rot”—her debut solo album—you will hear lullabies and angular rock with influences ranging from The Pixies to Crass.  You’ll come to learn about how Laura hates traffic and emails, but if you really listen, you’ll hear an album full of love songs.  And we hope you really listen and hear that too.",

        "description": "For the uninitiated, Sludgeworth are Chicago punk pioneers from the 1980’s that released a posthumous collection/discography album on Lookout Records back in the day—and it sold tens of thousands of copies, which was impressive for a defunct band.  With members of Screeching Weasel, they had obvious leanings towards melodic punk, but they also had a quintessential Midwest sound mixed in with some post-punk.  Think Naked Raygun and Fugazi.  And now, for the first time ever, Red Scare brings you “Losers of the Year” on vinyl.  Their first and only LP!  And we didn’t stop there: we’ve added two unreleased songs to the CD and digital version of this album.  Wild, right?!  The band actually broke up in the studio (drama!) during a recording session, but we’ve managed to salvage some of that unheard material for this milestone release.  Once again, it’s Red Scare to the rescue!",

Fast forward to the present: we released a teaser single when the ‘Weevils were asked to play a recent Riot Fest, and now it’s time for the main course, the big kahuna, the whole hog… the full length!  It’s been 14 years since their last album, so they’ve spent ages putting together their best new material.  It was tracked in their hometown, but we sent it out to The Blasting Room (Descendents, Propagandhi, etc.) to be mixed, because we knew we had hit$ on our hands!  They’re naming the album after themselves because they’re all essential workers: educators, first responders, and of course leading the way is Dr. Daryl Wilson, the most ostentatious Afro-Punk frontman in the Midwest.  It’s one big unity song for the punk community and the workin’ stiffs that got us through the Pandemic, and everyone is invited to this party.",

Tightwire came storming outta Minneapolis in 2018 with a catchy/crusty/spooky debut and toured with Dillinger Four, Chixdiggit!, Off With Their Heads, and more.  Since then, they've only gotten stronger with the addition of Noelle on second guitar and added vocals.  She's Iowa punk royalty!  And now that Tightwire 2.0 is armed with 12 new songs about darkness and damnation, they'll be hitting the road on some tasty tours and festivals.",

When we reissued their LP in 2022, they promised us they would not be playing live as they were disbanded... then they changed their minds (yay!) and their comeback show sold out in six minutes. Six minutes! They went from R.I.P. to BTS. Then the folks at Riot Fest offered Sludgeworth a slot on the big outdoor stage, and it was a happy ending for the old friends... except it wasn't the end. Singer Dan told us the band had no plans for new material, but they were jamming at rehearsal, and as Dan explained to us, \"It just happened organically. It felt natural, and the songs felt good.\" And these are those songs. Sludgeworth is a special band from a special time in Chicago punk, and it's rare to witness an authentic comeback, but the \"Together Not Together\" 7-inch is a second chance for us to appreciate their renewed greatness.",

        "description": "The world has been begging Wisconsin's Arms Aloft for new material and they finally deliver it... as a surprise release on Election Day 2024?  Ouch, knife twist.  It's as though they wanna sabotage the state AND their own music career.  But let's be frank, the Eau Claire quartet is probably wise to sneak out a release before Doomsday hits the USA, so let these four songs be America's elegy.  Or who knows, maybe we survive 2024 and our reward is this EP of excellent Leftist punk rock?  Can't wait to find out!",
